# Spider-Verse

## Background
This project is inspired by the **Marvel Spider-Man** movies. Spider-Verse is a multiverse
that connects all versions of Spider-Man from across the multiverse.
The idea is that every universe that has a Spider hero they are part of this great web.

Spider-Man Miguel from Earth-928B, leader of the Spider Society, believes that each of the Spider hero has to go
through a **"canon event"** such as the death of a police captain
close to Spider-Man, and straying from those events threatens r
. However, Spider-Man Miles from Earth-1610,
who doesn't believe the canon event theory, wants to stop his uncle from being murdered without causing
his universe to collapse.

## Proposal
In this application, the users will be able to participate this Spider-Verse by adding
new Spider heroes as well as choosing them to be either supporters or opponents of the cannon event theory.
Then the corresponding universe will reveal the result based on the choice at the end.

The users will be able to:
- create new Spider heroes with name, universeID, stance for supporter or opponent
- view the list of all spider heroes in a specific universe, with their stance
- view the list of all spider heroes in all universes
- view the list of supporters in all universes
- view the list of opponents in all universes
- view the list of safe universes
- view the list of collapsed universes
- view the list of all universes
- save my created characters to file (if I so choose)
- load my previously created characters from file (if I so choose)
